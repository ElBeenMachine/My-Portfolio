## About the Project

This project has evolved over the years, from a static portfolio build in basic html to a portfolio managed by my [portfolio dashboard](https://gitlab.com/elbeenmachine/portfolio-dashboard-template) project, dynamically updating and fetching projects from a remote database.

The production release of this project can be found at [https://www.beenhamow.co.uk](www.beenhamow.co.uk).
